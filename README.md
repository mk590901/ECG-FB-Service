# ECG FB Service

This application is an adaptation of the project https://github.com/mk590901/data_exchanger to work as a service.

## Introduction

The main idea: the __ECG__ signal simulator is moved to a service that transmits data to the frontend. The __flutter_foreground_task__ package (https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_foreground_task) package is used for implementation.
